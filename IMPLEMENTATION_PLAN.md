## ‚èπÔ∏è Milestone 1 ‚Äî Local Stock Price Agent

> Goal: Build agent using Microsoft Agent Framework, run agent locally, fetch stock price using user input.

- ‚èπÔ∏è Deploy a foundation model (e.g., GPT-4) in Azure AI Foundry
- ‚èπÔ∏è Configure local agent (Python) to connect to AI Foundry model endpoint
- ‚èπÔ∏è Accept user query: "What's the price of Tesla?"
- ‚èπÔ∏è Use AI model to extract ticker or company name from input
- ‚èπÔ∏è Call stock price API (e.g., `yfinance`, Twelve Data) via agent tools
- ‚èπÔ∏è Return clean response with current stock price
- ‚èπÔ∏è Agent runs locally but uses Azure AI Foundry model

## ‚èπÔ∏è Milestone 2 ‚Äî Deploy Agent to Azure

> Goal: Move local agent to Azure AI Foundry (Agent Service)

- ‚èπÔ∏è Package the stock agent code
- ‚èπÔ∏è Deploy to Azure AI Foundry (single-agent)
- ‚èπÔ∏è Configure environment + endpoint
- ‚èπÔ∏è Test via Azure Playground or API
- ‚èπÔ∏è Optional: expose via web or chat frontend

## ‚èπÔ∏è Milestone 3 ‚Äî Add Currency Agent + Multi-Agent Setup

> Goal: Convert to SEK using a separate Currency Agent via multi-agent orchestration.

- ‚èπÔ∏è Build a standalone **Currency Agent** (USD‚ÜíSEK)
- ‚èπÔ∏è Register both Stock and Currency agents in Azure AI Foundry
- ‚èπÔ∏è Enable task handoff between agents
- ‚èπÔ∏è Test scenario:  
  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the price of NVIDIA in SEK?‚Äù ‚Üí  
  Stock Agent fetches USD price ‚Üí  
  Currency Agent converts ‚Üí  
  Combined response returned
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add trace/logging for cross-agent debugging

## ‚èπÔ∏è Milestone 4 ‚Äî Add RAG with Watchlist as Grounding

> Goal: Use a personal stock watchlist for retrieval-augmented responses.

- ‚èπÔ∏è Create `watchlist.json` with 10 stock entries
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add embeddings using Azure AI Search or FAISS
- ‚èπÔ∏è Integrate as RAG grounding data
- ‚èπÔ∏è Agent should answer:
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in my watchlist?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúShow prices for all my watchlist stocks‚Äù
- ‚èπÔ∏è Restrict retrieval scope to user‚Äôs own watchlist

## ‚èπÔ∏è Milestone 5 ‚Äî Reporting Agent (Optional)

> Goal: Automatically generate reports based on agent outputs.

- ‚èπÔ∏è Add Report Agent that orchestrates others
- ‚èπÔ∏è Collect prices (USD), conversions (SEK), and watchlist context
- ‚èπÔ∏è Generate Markdown, JSON, or email summaries
- ‚èπÔ∏è Support scheduled or manual triggering
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add simple daily summary:
